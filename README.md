<h1>Google Sheets Project for Accenture (Forage)</h1>

 ### 

<h2>Description</h2>
Social Buzz, a rapidly growing social media and content creation platform, engaged the Accenture firm for a 3-month initial project to help them manage their massive big data environment, prepare for an upcoming IPO, and gain insights into content popularity. This job simulation allowed me to demonstrate my capabilities in analyzing content data to identify the top 5 most popular categories.
<br />

<h2>Where the Dataset Came From</h2>

The dataset was provided from Social Buzzâ€™s internal system. It consisted of 7 total datasets with each dataset having different columns and values. I was also provided a data model where the relationships between all of the data sets were established to help with merging. 

<h2>Tools Used</h2>

- <b>Google Sheets</b>

<h2>Steps Taken</h2>

- Planned out what columns were important for my analysis; removed unnecessary ones
- Prepared the dataset by merging necessary columns into one comprehensive dataset using spreadsheet functions such as VLOOKUP
  - Other spreadsheet functions I used were: SUMIF() and COUNTIF()
- Cleaned the dataset checking for duplicates, empty cells, and other inconsistencies
   - I used the Data tab in google sheets to aid in data cleaning.
   - I used conditional formating to find any "blanks" and remove them
- Created a simple yet complete chart using Microsoft Excel's chart insert pivot table and insert chart capabilities to showcase to stakeholders the <b>Top 5 Most Popular Content Categories</b>
- Delivered a presentation to relay my findings and conclusions to Social Buzz
  

<h2>Key Findings</h2>

- The Top 5 Most Popular categories were:
   - Animals
   - Science
   - Healthy Eating
   - Technology
   - Food

<h2>Questions</h2>

What is the retention rate of users interacting with top content categories?
